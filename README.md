# Communications Technology Laboratory
## About this repository
This is a teaching resource repository on digital communications theory techniques and applications. Througth simulations and hands-on experimentation on software defined radio devices, the material allows students to learn the fundamental concepts by  combining theory and practice.

## Main topics
* Remore SDR Lab
* Detection theory
* Waveform design and matched filter
* Channel modeling
* Synchronization

## What you will learn
* Measuring a system's ability to detect patterns/stimuli/signals in information despite background noise.
* How digital communication systems work
* How to evaluate channel impairments
* What algorithms are required to recover information

## What you will need:
* Basic Probability 
* Signal Processing and System 
* Fundamentals of Programming
